In the context of systemd, "drop-ins" refer to additional configuration files or snippets that can be added to extend or override the configuration of a specific unit. In this case, for `systemd-timesyncd`, you can use drop-in files to customize its configuration without directly modifying the main configuration file.

Here's how you can use drop-ins for `systemd-timesyncd`:

1. **Create the Drop-in Directory:**
   First, create the drop-in directory if it doesn't exist:

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf.d
   ```

2. **Create a Drop-in Configuration File:**
   Now, you can create a new configuration file in the `timesyncd.conf.d` directory. For example:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf.d/my-custom-settings.conf
   ```

3. **Add Configuration in the Drop-in File:**
   In this file, you can add your specific configuration settings. For instance, if you want to set a custom NTP server:

   ```ini
   [Time]
   NTP=time.google.com
   ```

   Save the file.

4. **Restart systemd-timesyncd:**
   After creating the drop-in file, restart the `systemd-timesyncd` service to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd
   ```

Using drop-ins provides a modular and organized way to extend the configuration of systemd units without directly modifying their main configuration files. This approach makes it easier to manage changes and keeps your modifications separate from the default settings.

Feel free to create multiple drop-in files with different settings, and systemd will apply them in a cumulative manner. If you later want to revert changes, you can simply delete or disable the drop-in files.
